<p>A profit boost is another common type of promotion. A profit boost&nbsp;<em>increases</em> your payout to some percentage higher than it normally would be. They can&nbsp;gaurantee profit when utilized as a matched betting strategy.</p>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>Profit boosts have a bit more criteria than a bonus bet. The first part of a profit boost is the&nbsp;<strong>boost percentage</strong>. This is how much more&nbsp;<em>profit</em> you will win from a bet when the promotion is applied. The second is the&nbsp;<strong>maximum wager limit</strong>, which is the ceiling for how much the boost can apply to. For example, BetMGM may give you a 50% profit boost for up to $50. You can then place a $50 bet on a +100 odd line (even), and instead of being returned $100 for winning, you will earn $150.</p>
<p>A key point here is that you don't boost the entire returns (stake + profit), but&nbsp;<em>just the profit</em>. That's why in the example above you would only earn $150, not $200.</p>
<p>Like all other types of promotions, there could potentially be more criteria that determines an eligible bet such as the sport being wagered on, or minimum odds. Additionally, they tend to have expiration dates as well, so don't procrastinate using our converter!</p>
