<p>Matched Betting is a <strong>risk free</strong> technique to <strong>gaurantee profit</strong> from free bets. Bookmakers&nbsp;(like Fanduel, Draftkings, etc.) will run promotions where you are awarded a free bet as an incentive to sign up. By <em>hedging</em> your free bet through placing money on the&nbsp;<em>opposite</em> side, you can ensure to make money no matter&nbsp;which side wins.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Let's start with a simple example.</h3>
<p>Say you created a Fanduel account during their new user promotion. Fanduel then awards your account with $200 in "bonus bets". A bonus bet on Fanduel refers to a set of credits that you can place on a team, proposition, or any other entity. If the bet wins, you are only awarded the&nbsp;<em>profits</em> of that bet. If it loses, the bet goes away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To gaurantee a profit from this, you could place your $200 bonus bet on the Chicago Bulls. Say they were playing the Los Angelos Lakers, you would then&nbsp;<em>hedge</em> this bet by then placing $100 on the Lakers.</p>
<p>If the Bulls win, you win your bonus bet, cashing in on just the profits, so $200 from the promotional bet. Clearly, you would lose the money from the hedge bet, but since that stake is smaller than your profit you would be in the green $100.</p>
<p>If the Lakers win, you get your stake back, and profit $100 for winning the bet. Your bonus bet would disappear, but since that was given to you for free, you're still up $100.</p>
<h3>But there are some problems...</h3>
<p>This is an oversimplification that has some issues. It assumes that both sides of the bet payout exactly what you put in (an even bet). In reality, the lines for each side are not even, the Bulls line may pay out 2 or 3 times what you put in if they're underdogs, or maybe only pay out half of what you put in if they are the favorites.&nbsp;Even just slight changes in the odds has a big difference on whether or not you'll make money.</p>
<p>You may also notice that you only profit 50% of the promotional value given out in this example, which is less than ideal. Perhaps you figure that that there are certain events which could give you more money, but how can you find them and ensure that you'll be profitting more? How do you know what amount of money needs to be hedged on the other side?</p>
