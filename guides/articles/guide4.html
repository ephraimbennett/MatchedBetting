<p>Site credit is usually less common than bonus bets or profit boosts, but still comes into play regularly. They tend to be rewarded as the payout for some other kind of promotion, such as a second chance bet or deposit match bonuses. They are critical to understand if you want to make use of them. Read this guide&nbsp;<em>before</em> the second chance guide.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is a Site Credit?</h3>
<p>A site credit is like a bonus bet, but instead of only being payed the profits, you are also returned the stake. This makes it more valuable than a bonus bet, as the same listed money will return a lot more. Some sportsbooks refer to them as "Bonus Funds" or "Bet Credits" as well. In general, the conversion rate for site credit is considered nearly 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key thing to note is that you must&nbsp;<em>play</em> and&nbsp;<em>win</em> your bets in order to receive the actual cash of a site credit. This is how bookmakers prevent losing too much money with them. But here at HedgeR, your not going to be the average customer. By hedging both sides of the wager, you're going to secure your money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oftentimes there are unique requirements to withdraw your site credit other than simply winning. One example is a&nbsp;<strong>rollover</strong>, which is a requirement for how many times you must bet the site credit in order to actually get it as withdrawable cash. If the rollover is 1-2x, you can use our methods to make some money. Otherwise, we'd reccommend not messing with higher rollover requirements unless you're a more advanced user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important feature to note is&nbsp;<strong>minimum odds</strong>. In&nbsp;an attempt to&nbsp;prevent customers from cashing out easy, bookmakers may enforce a floor to the odds you can place the site credit on. The higher the odds, the less likely you are to win, which makes it difficult to get your money. Our algorithm can take this into account and circumvent this through hedging however. But it's important that you identify any minimum odds and put it into the calculator.</p>
<h3>Step-By-Step</h3>

<li>In our example we selected the Chicago White Sox vs the Houston Astros moneyline, with a minimum odds of +100 at BetRivers. Through just the information in the table, we know we need to place the site credit on the White Sox on BetRivers, and then hedge it on Fanduel by betting on the Astros for $228.57. A more detailed view can be seen by selecting "Explain This":<img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/doptbdbiy/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_auto,c_scale,dpr_auto/site_credit_explanation_aiv1ux.png" alt="Site Credit Explanation" /></li>

<h3>&nbsp;Conclusion</h3>
<p>Site Credits have the highest conversion rate out of any type of promotion, but they are also pretty rare. If you have a site credit, you can be sure to make a lot of money out of it. Typically they are awardede as the backup bet in a second chance promotion, which is going to be the next guide. Understanding site credits is critical to being able to use matched betting effectively with second chance bets.&nbsp;</p>
